# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a web application aimed at automating and simplifying the day-to-day operations of a library. With a user-friendly interface, it helps track book availability, issue/return of books, and book management. The system offers separate roles for the *Admin* and *User*, ensuring efficient book management and usage.

### Key Features:
- *User Registration & Login*: Users can register and log in to manage their borrowing activities.
- *Admin Features*: Admins have access to a dashboard where they can:
  - Add, update, and remove books.
  - Manage users and view issued book history.
  - Monitor the status of borrowed and returned books.
- *Book Issue & Return*: Users can issue books for a certain period and return them once done.
- *Book Search*: Users can search books by title, author, or genre.
- *Notifications*: Users are notified about overdue books and return deadlines.
- *User History*: Track all borrowed books and their return status.
